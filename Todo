High priority:

Medium priority:

Low priority:
Refactor classes introducing lombok annotations (for example remove constructors and replace them with RequiredArgsConstructor)

No priority:
Refactor app introducing service.
    I decided that (for now), Auth module won't receive refactoring with the scope to serve the classic architecture (resource - service - repository) for the following reasons:
        - Auth is pretty entangled with Spring security configuration, so we can leave it as it is for the moment, since we have higher priorities for other modules
        - It would change a lot of things and introduce complexity between layers (mappers, objects, and so on) that are not required in a microservice that (hopefully) will remain kind the same
